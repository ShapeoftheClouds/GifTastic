# GifTastic

* A dynamic web page that populates with gifs using the GIPHY API.

* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. When the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
